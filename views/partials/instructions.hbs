  <h2>HOW TO PLAY</h2>

  <p>The goal of the game is for you and your partner to spontaneously guess
    the same word in as few rounds as possible.</p>

    <ol class="instructions_list">

      <li>When the game begins, enter a random word into the text area.
        Your partner will do the same.</li>

      <li>After the countdown, your initial words will be
        revealed to each other.</li>

      <li>If you guess the same word, you win!</li>

      <li>If not, each player enters a new word,
        and the countdown begins again.</li>

      <li>The process repeats until both players guess the same word
        (or one of them dies of boredom).</li>

    </ol>
